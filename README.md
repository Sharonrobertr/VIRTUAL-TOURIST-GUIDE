          The tourism industry, managing travel accommodations poses a significant challenge due to its intricate network of properties, guests, and booking processes. Manual management is often time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Additionally, the lack of predictive capabilities hinders personalized user experiences, impacting overall customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Thus, there is a pressing need to design and implement a Python-based system capable of managing travel accommodations while leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict travel destinations and enhance decision-making processes.
          The proposed system addresses these challenges by integrating machine learning algorithms such as random forest and logistic regression. These algorithms streamline processes by automating tasks like predicting travel locations and suggesting relevant places based on user preferences. However, while these algorithms offer predictive capabilities, they may require substantial computational resources and extensive training datasets. 
          Leveraging advanced technology, particularly pretrained deep learning models like CNN-2D, the system expands its capabilities beyond traditional accommodation management. These models excel in tasks like detecting wheat diseases, showcasing the system's versatility across different domains.
